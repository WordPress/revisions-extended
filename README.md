# Revisions Extended

A WordPress plugin, developed for WordPress.org, that enables revisions ("updates") of already-published posts to be scheduled for the future. It accomplishes this by extending WordPress Core's existing revisions system and introduces other post statuses (such as `future`) for the revision post type.
